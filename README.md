The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to achieve
properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At the same
time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and justify the
extra effort of going wireless. This document lists the requirements of
the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure on top of a collection of wireless segments.  This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in wireless networks to achieve Service Level Objectives.
