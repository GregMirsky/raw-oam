<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
        Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) is an effort that extends DetNet
        to approach end-to-end deterministic performances over a network that
        includes scheduled wireless segments.
        In wired networks, many approaches try to enable Quality of Service (QoS) by
        implementing traffic differentiation so that routers handle each type of packets differently.
        However, this differentiated treatment was expensive for most applications.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        Their work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        However, wireless networks create specific challenges.
        First of all, radio bandwidth is significantly lower than for wired networks.
        In these conditions, the volume of signaling messages has to be very limited.
        Even worse, wireless links are lossy: a Layer 2 transmission may or may not be 
        decoded correctly by the receiver, depending on a broad set of parameters.
        Thus, providing high reliability through wireless segments is particularly challenging.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Wired networks rely on the concept of <em>links</em>. All the devices attached
        to a link receive any transmission. The concept of a link in wireless
        networks is somewhat different from what many are used to in wireline networks.
        A receiver may or may not receive a transmission, depending on
        the presence of a colliding transmission, the radio channel's quality, and the external interference.
        Besides, a wireless transmission is broadcast by nature: any <em>neighboring</em>
        device may be able to decode it. This document includes detailed information on what the implications for the OAM features are.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Last but not least, radio links present volatile characteristics.
        If the wireless networks use an unlicensed band, packet losses are not anymore temporally
        and spatially independent.
        Typically, links may exhibit a very bursty characteristic, where several 
        consecutive packets may be dropped, because of e.g. temporary external interference.
        Thus, providing availability and reliability on top of the wireless infrastructure 
        requires specific Layer 3 mechanisms to counteract these bursty losses. 
    </t>
	   
    <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276"/>.
        They define a toolset for fault detection, isolation, and performance measurement.
    </t>
       
    <t>
        The primary purpose of this document is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM
        features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
        on top of a collection of wireless segments.
      	This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in 
    	wireless networks to provide availability and predictability.
	</t>

	<section title="Terminology">

   <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      	We expect to implement an OAM framework in RAW networks to maintain a real-time 
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as delay and reliability, assigned to each data flow.
   </t>

    	<t>
            We re-use here the same terminology as <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-oam-framework"/>:
        </t>
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
            <li>
                OAM entity: a data flow to be monitored for defects and/or its performance metrics measured.;
            </li>
            
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            
            I think it is useful to differentiate between MEP and MIP. But we need to consider the origin of the term is Layer 2. For IETF we might choose/define somewhat different terms, e.g., Test Point for MEP and Monitor Point for MIP.
            -->
        
            <li>
                Maintenance End Point (MEP): OAM devices crossed when entering/exiting
                the network. In RAW, it corresponds mostly to the source or destination
                of a data flow. OAM message can be exchanged between two MEPs;
            </li>
     
            <li>
                Maintenance Intermediate endPoint (MIP): an OAM system along the
                flow; a MIP MAY respond to an OAM message generated by the MEP;
            </li>

            <li>control/management/data plane: the control and management planes
               are used to configure and control the network (long-term). The
               data plane takes the individual decision. Relative to a data
               flow, the control and/or management plane can be out-of-band;
                </li>

            <li><t>
                Active measurement methods (as defined in
               <xref target="RFC7799"/>) modify a normal data flow by
               inserting novel fields, injecting specially constructed test
               packets <xref target="RFC2544" format="default"/>).  It is critical for the
               quality of information obtained using an active method that
               generated test packets are in-band with the monitored data
               flow. In other words, a test packet is required to cross the
               same network nodes and links and receive the same Quality of
               Service (QoS) treatment as a data packet.

               Active methods may implement one of these two strategies:
               </t>
               <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
                
                    <li>
                        In-band: control information follows the same path as the data packets.
                        In other words, a failure in the data plane may prevent the control information to reach the destination (e.g., end-device or controller).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        out-of-band: control information is sent separately from the data packets.
                        Thus, the behavior of control vs. data packets may differ;
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>

            <li>Passive measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> infer
               information by observing unmodified existing flows.
            </li>

            </ul>
        
        
        <t>
        We also adopt the following terminology, which is particularly relevant for RAW segments.
        </t>
        
        <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
          

            <li> piggybacking vs. dedicated control packets:
            control information may be encapsulated in specific (dedicated) control packets.
            Alternatively, it may be piggybacked in existing data packets, when the MTU is larger than the actual packet length.
            Piggybacking makes specifically sense in wireless networks, as the cost (bandwidth and energy) is not linear with the packet size.
            </li>
            
            <li> router-over vs. mesh under:
                a control packet is either forwarded directly to the layer-3 next hop (mesh under) or handled hop-by-hop by each router.
                While the latter option consumes more resources, it allows to collect additionnal intermediary information, particularly relevant in wireless networks.
            </li>
            
             <li>
               Defect: a temporary change in the network (e.g., a radio link which is
               broken due to a mobile obstacle);
           </li>
    
           <li>
               Fault: a definite change which may affect the network performance, e.g., a node runs out of energy.
           </li>
           <li>
                End-to-end delay: the time between the packet generation and its reception by the destination.
            </li>

<!-- INTEREST OF OAM          -->
<section title="Role of OAM in RAW">
	<t>
      RAW networks expect to make the communications reliable and predictable on top of a
      wireless network infrastructure. 
      Most critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the data flows it
      generates.
      RAW considers network plane protocol elements such as OAM to improve the RAW operation 
      at the service and the forwarding sub-layers.
	</t>


	<t>
To respect strict guarantees, RAW relies on the Path Selection Engine (PSE) (as
defined in <xref target="I-D.pthubert-raw-architecture" /> to monitor and
maintain the L3 network. A L2 scheduler may be used to allocate transmission opportunities,
based on the radio link characteristics, SLO of the flows, the number of packets to forward.
The PSE exploits the L2 ressources reserved by the scheduler, and organizes the L3 paths to
introduce redundancy, fault tolerance, and create backup paths.
OAM represents the core of the pre-provisioning process by supervising the network.
It maintains maintains a global view of the network resources, to detect defects, faults, over-provisionning, anomalies.

	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
Strictly speaking, PREOF also includes an order preservation. Do you see it as the required element in RAW?
-->

	<t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths have to be provisioned
      so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever the conditions.
      The Packet Replication and Elimination Function (<xref target="I-D.thubert-bier-replication-elimination"/>) on a node is typically controlled by the PSE.
      OAM mechanisms can be used to monitor that PREOF is working correctly on a node and within the domain.
	</t>
    
<!-- TODO-Greg-
I think that out-of-band OAM is useful in case of passive OAM that collects counters, statistics from the nodes, e.g., SNMP or Netconf/Restconf using YANG-based data models. Such methods may be used as systems have control and management channels already.
-->
	<t>
      To be energy-efficient, reserving some dedicated out-of-band resources
      for OAM seems idealistic, and only in-band solutions are considered here.
	</t>


	<t>
      RAW supports both proactive and on-demand troubleshooting.
      Proactively, it is necessary to detect anomalies, to report defects, or to reduce over-provisionning if it is not required.
      However, on-demand may also be required to identify the cause of a specific defect.
      Indeed, some specific faults may only be detected with a global, detailed view of the network, which is too expensive to acquire in the normal operating mode.
	</t>
    
    <t>
        The specific characteristics of RAW are discussed below.
        </t>
    
    
    <section title="Link concept and quality">
        <t>
            In wireless networks, a <em>link</em> does not exist physically.
            A device has a set of <strong>neighbors</strong> that correspond to all the devices that have a non null probability of receiving correctly its packets.
            We make a distinction between:
            </t>
        
            <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
                <li> point-to-point (p2p) link with one transmitter and one receiver.
                    These links are used to transmit unicast packets.
                </li>
                
                <li> point-to-multipoint (p2m) link associates one transmitter and a collection of receivers.
                    For instance, broadcast packets assume the existence of p2m links to avoid duplicating a broadcast packet to reach each possible radio neighbor.
                </li>
            </ul>

    
            <t>
            In scheduled radio networks, p2m and p2p links are commonly not scheduled simultaneously to save energy, and/or to reduce the number of collisions.
            More precisely, only one part of the neighbors may wake-up at a given instant.
            </t>
        <t>
            Anycast are used in p2m links to improve the reliability.
            A collection of receivers are scheduled to wake-up simutaneously, so that the transmission fails only if none of the receivers is able to decode the packet.
            </t>
     
        <t>
            Each wireless link is associated with a link quality, often measured as the
            Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), i.e., the probability that the receiver can decode the packet correctly.
            It is worth noting that this link quality depends on many criteria, such as the level of external
            interference, the presence of concurrent transmissions, or the radio channel state.
            This link quality is even time-variant.
            For p2m links, we have consequently a collection of PDR (one value per receiver).
            Other more sophisticated, aggregated metrics exist for these p2m links, such as <xref target="anycast-property"/>
            </t>
        
        </section>
    
    <section title="Broadcast Transmissions">
        <t>
            In modern switching networks, the unicast transmission is delivered uniquely to the destination.
            Wireless networks are much closer to the ancient <strong>shared access</strong> networks.
            Practically, unicast and broadcast frames are handled similarly at the physical layer.
            The link layer is just in charge of filtering the frames to discard irrelevant receptions (e.g., different unicast MAC address).
            </t>
        
        <t>
            However, contrary to wired networks, we cannot be sure that a packet is received by
            <strong>all</strong> the devices attached to the Layer 2 segment.
            It depends on the radio channel state between the transmitter(s) and the receiver(s).
            In particular, concurrent transmissions may be possible or not, depending on the radio conditions (e.g., do the different transmitters use a different radio channel or are they sufficiently spatially separated?)
            </t>
        
        </section>
    


    <section title="Complex Layer 2 Forwarding">
        <t>
            Multiple neighbors may receive a transmission.
            Thus, anycast Layer 2 forwarding helps to maximize the reliability by assigning multiple receivers to a single transmission.
            That way, the packet is lost only if <strong>none</strong> of the receivers decode it.
            Practically, it has been proven that different neighbors may exhibit very different radio conditions, and
            that reception independency may hold for some of them <xref target="anycast-property"/>.
            </t>
        </section>

  
    <section title="End-to-end delay">
      <t>
            In a wireless network, additionnal transmissions opportunities are provisionned to accomodate packet losses.
            Thus, the end-to-end delay consists of:
        </t>
            <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">

    	OAM features will enable RAW with robust operation both for forwarding and routing 
    	purposes.
	</t>
    
    <!-- TODO-Greg-
    We can clarify that this is a method of passive OAM (according to RFC 7799 classification of OAM performance measurement methods).
    -->

    <section title="Information Collection">
           <t>
               The model to exchange information should be the same as for DetNet network, for the sake of inter-operability.
               YANG may typically fulfill this objective.
            </t>
           
           <t>
               However, RAW networks imply specific constraints (e.g., low bandwidth, packet losses, cost of medium access) that may require to minimize the volume of information to collect.
               Thus, we discuss in <xref target="dataretrieval"/> different ways to collect information, i.e., transfer physically the OAM information from the emitter to the receiver.
               </t>
           </section>

    
    
    <section title="Continuity Check">
		<t>
			Similarly to DetNet, we need to verify that the source and the destination are connected (at least one valid path exists)
 		</t>
        
        </section>

        
        <section title="Connectivity Verification">

		<t>
            As in DetNet, we have to verify the absence of
            misconnection.
            We focus here on the RAW specificities.
        </t>
     
        
        
        <t>
             Because of radio transmissions' broadcast nature, several
   receivers may be active at the same time to enable anycast Layer 2
   forwarding. Thus, the connectivity
            verification must test any combination.
            We also consider priority-based mechanisms for anycast forwarding, i.e., all the receivers have
            different probabilities of forwarding a packet.
            To verify a delay SLO for a given flow, we must also consider all the possible combinations,
            leading to a probability distribution function for end-to-end transmissions.
            If this verification is implemented
            naively, the number of combinations to test may be exponential and too costly
            for wireless networks with low bandwidth.

    <section title="Route Tracing">


		<t>
            Wireless networks are broadcast by nature: a radio transmission can be decoded by any radio neighbor.
            In multihop wireless networks, several paths exist between two endpoints.
            In hub networks, a device may be covered by several Access Points.
            We should choose the most efficient path or AP, concerning specifically the reliability, and the delay.
       </t>
        
        <t>
            Thus, multipath routing / multi-attachment can be considered to make the network fault-tolerant.
            Even better, we can exploit the broadcast nature of wireless networks to exploit: we may have multiple Maintenance Intermediate Endpoints (MIP) for each of this kind of hop.
            While it may be reasonable in the multi-attachment case, the complexity quickly increases with the path length.
            Indeed, each Maintenance Intermediate Endpoint has several possible next hops in the forwarding plane.
			Thus, all the possible paths between two maintenance endpoints should be retrieved, which may quickly become intractable if we apply a naive approach.

            Wired networks tend to present stable performances.
            On the contrary, wireless networks are time-variant.
            We must consequently make a distinction between normal evolutions and malfunction.

        	The network has isolated and identified the cause of the fault.

            We must consequently collect metrics and implement algorithms tailored for wireless networking.
        </t>
        <t>
            For instance, the decrease in the link quality may be caused by several factors: external interference, obstacles, multipath fading, mobility.

<!--    ADMINISTRATION          -->
<section title="Administration">
   
   <t>
      The RAW network has to expose a collection of metrics to support an operator making proper decisions, including:
    </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
         <li>
            Packet losses: the time-window average and maximum values of the
            number of packet losses have to be measured. Many critical applications
            stop to work if a few consecutive packets are dropped;
            </li>
         
         <li>
            Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a very common metric
            in wireless to denote the link quality. The radio chipset is in charge
            of translating a received signal strength into a normalized
            quality indicator;
            </li>
         
         <li>
            Delay: the time elapsed between a packet generation / enqueuing
            and its reception by the next hop;
            </li>
         
         <li>
            Buffer occupancy: the number of packets present in the buffer,
            for each of the existing flows.
            </li>
         <li>
            Battery lifetime: the expected remaining battery lifetime of the
            device. Since many RAW devices might be battery powered, this is an
            important metric for an operator to take proper decisions.
            </li>

         <li>
            Mobility: if a device is known to be mobile, this might be
            considered by an operator to take proper decisions.
            </li>

         
      </ul>

   <t>
      These metrics should be collected per device, virtual circuit, and path, as detnet already does.
      However, we have to face in RAW to a finer granularity:
     </t>
     <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
         
         <li>per radio channel to measure, e.g., the level of external interference,
            and to be able to apply counter-measures (e.g., blacklisting).
            </li>
         <li>per physical radio technology / interface if a device has multiple NIC.
             </li>
         
         <li>
            per link to detect misbehaving link (assymetrical link, fluctuating quality).
        </li>
         
        <li>
            per resource block: a collision in the schedule is particularly challenging to identify in radio networks with spectrum reuse.
            In particular, a collision may not be systematic (depending on the radio characteristics and the traffic profile).
            </li>
         </ul>

   
   
   
         
   <section title="Worst-case metrics">
      <t>
         RAW inherits the same requirements as DetNet: we need to know the distribution of a collection of metrics.
         However, wireless networks are known to be highly variable.
         Changes may be frequent, and may exhibit a periodical pattern.
         Collecting and analyzing this amount of measurements is challenging.
         </t>
         
     <t>
         Wireless networks are known to be lossy, and RAW has to implement strategies to improve reliability on top of unreliable links.
         Reliability is typically achieved through Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), and Forward Error Correction (FEC).
         Since the different flows have not the same SLO, RAW must adjust the ARQ and FEC based on the link and path characteristics.

   <section title="Efficient data retrieval" anchor="dataretrieval">

           We have to minimize the number of statistics / measurements to exchange:

               energy efficiency: low-power devices have to limit the volume of monitoring

           </li>
           <li>
               bandwidth: wireless networks exhibit a bandwidth significantly lower than
               wired, best-effort networks.

           <li>
               per-packet cost: it is often more expensive to send several packets instead

          <t>
         In conclusion, we have to take care of power and bandwidth consumption.
         The following techniques aim to reduce the cost of such maintenance:
         </t>
          
         <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
            <li>
               on-path collection: some control information is inserted in the data packets
               if they do not fragment the packet (i.e., the MTU is not exceeded).
               Information Elements represent a standardized way to handle such information.
               IP hop by hop extension headers may help to collect metrics all along the path;
               </li>
            
            <li>
               flags/fields: we have to set-up flags in the packets to monitor to be able
               to monitor the forwarding process accurately.
               A sequence number field may help to detect packet losses.
               Similarly, path inference tools such as <xref target="ipath"/> insert
               additional information in the headers to identify the path followed by a
               packet a posteriori.
               </li>
            
            <li>
                hierarchical monitoring: localized and centralized mechanisms have to be combined together.
                Typically, a local mechanism should contiuously monitor a set of metrics and trigger distant OAM exchances only when a fault is detected (but possibly not identified).
                For instance, local temporary defects must not trigger expensive OAM transmissions.
                Besides, the wireless segments represent often the weakest parts of a path: the volume of control information they produce has to be fixed accordingly.

<!--   MAINTENANCE          -->

<!-- speak about predictive maintenance? -->

   <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
        Maintenance needs to facilitate the maintenance (repairs and upgrades).
        In wireless networks, repairs are expected to occur much more frequently, since the link quality may be highly time-variant.
        Thus, maintenance represents a key feature for RAW.
     </t>


 
    <section title="Soft transition after reconfiguration">
        <t>
            Because of the wireless medium, the link quality may fluctuate, and the network needs to reconfigure itself continuously.
            During this transient state, flows may begin to be gradually re-forwarded, consuming resources in different parts of the network.
            OAM has to make a distinction between a metric that changed because of a legal network change (e.g., flow  redirection) and an unexpected event (e.g., a fault).
       </t>
    </section>
 
    <section title="Predictive maintenance">
        <t>
            RAW needs to implement self-optimization features.
            While the network is configured to be fault-tolerant, a reconfiguration may be required to keep on respecting long-term objectives.
            Obviously, the network keeps on respecting the SLO after a node's crash, but a reconfiguration is required to handle the future faults.
            In other words, the reconfiguration delay MUST be strictly smaller than the inter-fault time.
        </t>
        <t>
            The network must continuously retrieve the state of the network,
            to judge about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
        </t>
            <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
               <li> the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
                  optimally (e.g., a better path exists);
               </li>
               <li>
                  the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
                  reconfigurations.
                  For this transient period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.
               </li>
            </ul>
        <t>
            Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is significant.

               <t> reliable crossover: This is not treated explicitly but is tacit within 5.2. Internet
               Protocol executes the principle. The problem with this draft is it
               advocates adding state into the routing fabric without seeming to
               realize that that tends to defeat the reliable crossover principle. 5.3
               resource reservation clearly does this. Therefore, I recommend that the
               reliable crossover principle get explicit treatment at this stage so
               the tradeoffs can be properly weighed.
                 (We've gone through resource reservation protocols before - remember
               RSVP? - and they've not been very successful).
                   
                   </t>
           <t>detection of faults as they occur: 3.3 and 3.4 treat this, but, IMHO, the organization should again be
           cleaned up.  Back in the days when Simple Network Management Protocol
           was being worked up, a common acronym was FCAPS for [Fault Configuraion
           Accounting Performance Security]. Sounds to me like a pattern that this
           discussion could be mapped onto.
              In this case we have performance management solutions commingled
           with fault management ones. My experience is that QoS issues should
           always be the _last_ to be discussed, not the first.
              SNMP is nowhere mentioned in the draft. Sooner or later, you're
           going to need gets, sets and traps.  Is now the right time?
