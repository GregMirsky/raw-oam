<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
        Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) is an effort that extends DetNet
        to approach end-to-end deterministic performances over a network that
        includes scheduled wireless segments.
        In wired networks, many approaches try to enable Quality of Service (QoS) by
        implementing traffic differentiation so that routers handle each type of packets differently.
        However, this differentiated treatment was expensive for most applications.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        Their work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        However, wireless networks create specific challenges.
        First of all, radio bandwidth is significantly lower than for wired networks.
        In these conditions, the volume of signaling messages has to be very limited.
        Even worse, wireless links are lossy: a Layer 2 transmission may or may not be 
        decoded correctly by the receiver, depending on a broad set of parameters.
        Thus, providing high reliability through wireless segments is particularly challenging.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Wired networks rely on the concept of <spanx style="emph">links</spanx>. All the devices attached
        to a link receive any transmission. The concept of a link in wireless
        networks is somewhat different from what many are used to in wireline networks.
        A receiver may or may not receive a transmission, depending on
        the presence of a colliding transmission, the radio channel's quality, and the external interference.
        Besides, a wireless transmission is broadcast by nature: any <spanx style="emph">neighboring</spanx>
        device may be able to decode it. The document includes detailed information on what the implications for the OAM features are.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Last but not least, radio links present volatile characteristics.
        If the wireless networks use an unlicensed band, packet losses are not anymore temporally
        and spatially independent.
        Typically, links may exhibit a very bursty characteristic, where several 
        consecutive packets may be dropped.
        Thus, providing availability and reliability on top of the wireless infrastructure 
        requires specific Layer 3 mechanisms to counteract these bursty losses. 
    </t>
	   
    <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276"/>.
        It defines a toolset for fault detection, isolation, and performance measurement.
    </t>
       
    <t>
        The primary purpose of this document is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM
        features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
        on top of a collection of wireless segments.
      	This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in 
    	wireless networks to provide availability and predictability.
	</t>

	<section title="Terminology">

   <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      	We expect to implement an OAM framework in RAW networks to maintain a real-time 
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as delay and reliability, assigned to each data flow.
   </t>

    	<t>
            We re-use here the same terminology as <xref target="detnet-oam"/>:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>
                OAM entity: a data flow to be monitored for defects and/or its performance metrics measured.;
            </t>
            
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            
            I think it is useful to differentiate between MEP and MIP. But we need to consider the origin of the term is Layer 2. For IETF we might choose/define somewhat different terms, e.g., Test Point for MEP and Monitor Point for MIP.
            -->
        
            <t>
                Maintenance End Point (MEP): OAM devices crossed when entering/exiting
                the network. In RAW, it corresponds mostly to the source or destination
                of a data flow. OAM message can be exchanged between two MEPs;
            </t>
     
            <t>
                Maintenance Intermediate endPoint (MIP): an OAM system along the
                flow; a MIP MAY respond to an OAM message generated by the MEP;
            </t>

            <t>control/management/data plane: the control and management planes
               are used to configure and control the network (long-term). The
               data plane takes the individual decision. Relative to a data
               flow, the control and/or management plane can be out-of-band;
                </t>

            <t>Active measurement methods (as defined in
               <xref target="RFC7799"/>) modify a normal data flow by
               inserting novel fields, injecting specially constructed test
               packets <xref target="RFC2544"/>).  It is critical for the
               quality of information obtained using an active method that
               generated test packets are in-band with the monitored data
               flow. In other words, a test packet is required to cross the
               same network nodes and links and receive the same Quality of
               Service (QoS) treatment as a data packet.

               Active methods may implement one of these two strategies:
                <list style="symbols">
                
                    <t>
                        In-band: control information follows the same path as the data packets.
                        In other words, a failure in the data plane may prevent the control information to reach the destination (e.g., end-device or controller).
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        out-of-band: control information is sent separately from the data packets.
                        Thus, the behavior of control vs. data packets may differ;
                    </t>
                </list>

            </t>

            <t>Passive measurement methods <xref target="RFC7799"/> infer
               information by observing unmodified existing flows.
            </t>

            </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>
        We also adopt the following terminology, which is particularly relevant for RAW segments.
        
        <list style="symbols">
          

            <t> piggybacking vs. dedicated control packets:
            control information may be encapsulated in specific (dedicated) control packets.
            Alternatively, it may be piggybacked in existing data packets, when the MTU is larger than the actual packet length.
            Piggybacking makes specifically sense in wireless networks, as the cost (bandwidth and energy) is not linear with the packet size.
            </t>
            
            <t> router-over vs. mesh under:
                a control packet is either forwarded directly to the layer-3 next hop (mesh under) or handled hop-by-hop by each router.
                While the latter option consumes more resources, it allows to collect additionnal intermediary information, particularly relevant in wireless networks.
            </t>
            
             <t>
               Defect: a temporary change in the network (e.g., a radio link which is
               broken due to a mobile obstacle);
           </t>
    
           <t>
               Fault: a definite change which may affect the network performance, e.g., a node runs out of energy.
           </t>
           <t>
                End-to-end delay: the time between the packet generation and its reception by the destination.
            </t>

<!-- INTEREST OF OAM          -->
<section title="Role of OAM in RAW">
	<t>
      RAW networks expect to make the communications reliable and predictable on top of a
      wireless network infrastructure. 
      Most critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the data flows it
      generates.
      RAW considers network plane protocol elements such as OAM to improve the RAW operation 
      at the service and the forwarding sub-layers.
	</t>


	<t>
To respect strict guarantees, RAW relies on the Path Selection Engine (PSE) (as
defined in <xref target="I-D.pthubert-raw-architecture" /> to monitor and
maintain the network. As an example, a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller
may be used to schedule the transmissions in the deployed network, based on the
radio link characteristics, SLO of the flows, the number of packets to forward.
Thus, resources have to be provisioned a priori to handle any defect. OAM
represents the core of the pre-provisioning process and maintains the network
operational by updating the schedule dynamically.
	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
Strictly speaking, PREOF also includes an order preservation. Do you see it as the required element in RAW?
-->

	<t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths have to be provisioned
      so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever the conditions.
      The Packet Replication and Elimination Function (<xref target="PREF-draft"/>) on a node is typically controlled by the PSE.
      OAM mechanisms can be used to monitor that PREOF is working correctly on a node and within the domain.
	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
I think that out-of-band OAM is useful in case of passive OAM that collects counters, statistics from the nodes, e.g., SNMP or Netconf/Restconf using YANG-based data models. Such methods may be used as systems have control and management channels already.
-->
	<t>
      To be energy-efficient, reserving some dedicated out-of-band resources
      for OAM seems idealistic, and only in-band solutions are considered here.
	</t>


	<t>
       RAW supports both proactive and on-demand troubleshooting.
	</t>
    
    <t>
        The specific characteristics of RAW are discussed below.
        </t>
    
    
    <section title="Link concept and quality">
        <t>
            In wireless networks, a <spanx style="emph">link</spanx> does not exist physically.
            A common convention is to define a wireless link as a pair of devices
            that have a non-null probability of exchanging a packet that the receiver can decode.
            Similarly, we designate as <spanx style="strong">neighbor</spanx> any device with a radio link with a specific transmitter.
            </t>
        
        <t>
            Each wireless link is associated with a link quality, often measured as the
            Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), i.e., the probability that the receiver can decode the packet correctly.
            It is worth noting that this link quality depends on many criteria, such as the level of external
            interference, the presence of concurrent transmissions, or the radio channel state.
            This link quality is even time-variant.
            </t>
        </section>
    
    <section title="Broadcast Transmissions">
        <t>
            In modern switching networks, the unicast transmission is delivered uniquely to the destination.
            Wireless networks are much closer to the ancient <spanx style="strong">shared access</spanx> networks.
            Practically, unicast and broadcast frames are handled similarly at the physical layer.
            The link layer is just in charge of filtering the frames to discard irrelevant receptions (e.g., different unicast MAC address).
            </t>
        
        <t>
            However, contrary to wired networks, we cannot be sure that a packet is received by
            <spanx style="strong">all</spanx> the devices attached to the Layer 2 segment.
            It depends on the radio channel state between the transmitter(s) and the receiver(s).
            In particular, concurrent transmissions may be possible or not, depending on the radio conditions (e.g., do the different transmitters use a different radio channel or are they sufficiently spatially separated?)
            </t>
        
        </section>
    


    <section title="Complex Layer 2 Forwarding">
        <t>
            Multiple neighbors may receive a transmission.
            Thus, anycast Layer 2 forwarding helps to maximize the reliability by assigning multiple receivers to a single transmission.
            That way, the packet is lost only if <spanx style="strong">none</spanx> of the receivers decode it.
            Practically, it has been proven that different neighbors may exhibit very different radio conditions, and
            that reception independency may hold for some of them <xref target="anycast-property"/>.
            </t>
        </section>

  
    <section title="End-to-end delay">
      <t>
            In a wireless network, additionnal transmissions opportunities are provisionned to accomodate packet losses.
            Thus, the end-to-end delay consists of:
            
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                    Transmission delay, which is fixed and depends mainly on the data rate, and the presence or absence of an acknowledgement.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Residence time, corresponds to the buffering delay and depends on the schedule.
                    To account for retransmisisons, the residence time is equal to the difference between the time of last reception from the previous hop (among all the retransmisions) and the time of emission of the last retransmission.
                </t>

            </list>

    	purposes.
	</t>
    
    <!-- TODO-Greg-
    We can clarify that this is a method of passive OAM (according to RFC 7799 classification of OAM performance measurement methods).
    -->

    <section title="Information Collection">
           <t>
               The model to exchange information should be the same as for DetNet network, for the sake of inter-operability.
               YANG may typically fulfill this objective.
            </t>
           
           <t>
               However, RAW networks imply specific constraints (e.g., low bandwidth, packet losses, cost of medium access) that may require to minimize the volume of information to collect.
               Thus, we discuss in <xref target="dataretrieval"/> different ways to collect information, i.e., transfer physically the OAM information from the emitter to the receiver.

            misconnection.
            We focus here on the RAW specificities.
        </t>
     
        
        
        <t>
             Because of radio transmissions' broadcast nature, several
   receivers may be active at the same time to enable anycast Layer 2
   forwarding. Thus, the connectivity
            verification must test any combination.
            We also consider priority-based mechanisms for anycast forwarding, i.e., all the receivers have
            different probabilities of forwarding a packet.
            To verify a delay SLO for a given flow, we must also consider all the possible combinations,
            leading to a probability distribution function for end-to-end transmissions.
            If this verification is implemented
            naively, the number of combinations to test may be exponential and too costly
            for wireless networks with low bandwidth.

    <section title="Route Tracing">


		<t>
            Wireless networks are meshed by nature: we have many redundant radio links.
            These meshed networks are both an asset and a drawback: while several paths exist
            between two endpoints, and we should choose the most efficient one(s), concerning
            specifically the reliability, and the delay.
           </t>
        
        <t>
            Thus, multipath routing can be considered to make the network fault-tolerant.
            Even better, we can exploit the broadcast nature of wireless networks to exploit
            meshed multipath routing: we may have multiple Maintenance Intermediate Endpoints (MIP) for each
            hop in the path.
            In that way, each Maintenance Intermediate Endpoint has several possible next hops
            in the forwarding plane.
			Thus, all the possible paths between two maintenance endpoints should be 
			retrieved, which may quickly become untractable if we apply a naive approach.

            For instance, the decrease in the link quality may be caused by several factors: external interference, obstacles, multipath fading, mobility.

      The RAW network has to expose a collection of metrics to support an operator making proper decisions, including:
      
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>
            Packet losses: the time-window average and maximum values of the
            number of packet losses have to be measured. Many critical applications
            stop to work if a few consecutive packets are dropped;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a very common metric
            in wireless to denote the link quality. The radio chipset is in charge
            of translating a received signal strength into a normalized
            quality indicator;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Delay: the time elapsed between a packet generation / enqueuing
            and its reception by the next hop;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Buffer occupancy: the number of packets present in the buffer,
            for each of the existing flows.
            </t>
         <t>
            Battery lifetime: the expected remaining battery lifetime of the
            device. Since many RAW devices might be battery powered, this is an
            important metric for an operator to take proper decisions.
            </t>

         <t>
            Mobility: if a device is known to be mobile, this might be
            considered by an operator to take proper decisions.
            </t>

         
      </list>
      </t>
   <t>
      These metrics should be collected per device, virtual circuit, and path, as detnet already does.
      However, we have to face in RAW to a finer granularity:
      <list style="symbols">
         
         <t>per radio channel to measure, e.g., the level of external interference,
            and to be able to apply counter-measures (e.g., blacklisting).
            </t>
         
         <t>
            per link to detect misbehaving link (assymetrical link, fluctuating quality).
        </t>
        <t>
            per resource block: a collision in the schedule is particularly challenging to identify in radio networks with spectrum reuse.
            In particular, a collision may not be systematic (depending on the radio characteristics and the traffic profile)
            </t>
         </list>

   <section title="Worst-case metrics">
      <t>
         RAW inherits the same requirements as DetNet: we need to know the distribution of a collection of metrics.
         However, wireless networks are known to be highly variable.
         Changes may be frequent, and may exhibit a periodical pattern.
         Collecting and analyzing this amount of measurements is challenging.
         </t>
         
     <t>
         Wireless networks are known to be lossy, and RAW has to implement strategies to improve reliability on top of unreliable links.
         Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) has typically to enable retransmissions
         based on the end-to-end reliability and latency requirements.

               energy efficiency: low-power devices have to limit the volume of monitoring

         In conclusion, we have to take care of power and bandwidth consumption.
         The following techniques aim to reduce the cost of such maintenance:
         <list>
            <t>
               on-path collection: some control information is inserted in the data packets
               if they do not fragment the packet (i.e., the MTU is not exceeded).
               Information Elements represent a standardized way to handle such information;
               </t>
            
            <t>
               flags/fields: we have to set-up flags in the packets to monitor to be able
               to monitor the forwarding process accurately.
               A sequence number field may help to detect packet losses.
               Similarly, path inference tools such as <xref target="ipath"/> insert
               additional information in the headers to identify the path followed by a
               packet a posteriori.
               </t>
            
            <t>
                hierarchical monitoring;  localized and centralized mechanisms have to be combined together.
                Typically, a local mechanism should contiuously monitor a set of metrics and trigger distant OAM exchances only when a fault is detected (but possibly not identified).
                For instance, local temporary defects must not trigger expensive OAM transmissions.

<!--   MAINTENANCE          -->

<!-- speak about predictive maintenance? -->

   <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
        Maintenance needs to facilitate the maintenance (repairs and upgrades).
        In wireless networks, repairs are expected to occur much more frequently, since the link quality may be highly time-variant.
        Thus, maintenance represents a key feature for RAW.
     </t>


 
    <section title="Soft transition after reconfiguration">
        <t>
            Because of the wireless medium, the link quality may fluctuate, and the network needs to reconfigure itself continuously.
            During this transient state, flows may begin to be gradually re-forwarded, consuming resources in different parts of the network.
            OAM has to make a distinction between a metric that changed because of a legal network change (e.g., flow  redirection) and an unexpected event (e.g., a fault).
       </t>
    </section>
 
    <section title="Predictive maintenance">
        <t>
            RAW needs to implement self-optimization features.
            While the network is configured to be fault-tolerant, a reconfiguration may be required to keep on respecting long-term objectives.
            Obviously, the network keeps on respecting the SLO after a node's crash, but a reconfiguration is required to handle the future faults.
            In other words, the reconfiguration delay MUST be strictly smaller than the inter-fault time.
        </t>
        <t>
            The network must continuously retrieve the state of the network,
            to judge about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
            <list>
               <t> the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
                  optimally (e.g., a better path exists);
               </t>
               <t>
                  the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
                  reconfigurations.
                  For this transient period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.
               </t>
            </list>
            Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is significant.

               realize that that tends to defeat the reliable crossover principle. 5.3
               resource reservation clearly does this. Therefore, I recommend that the
               reliable crossover principle get explicit treatment at this stage so
               the tradeoffs can be properly weighed.
                 (We've gone through resource reservation protocols before - remember

           discussion could be mapped onto.
              In this case we have performance management solutions commingled
           with fault management ones. My experience is that QoS issues should
           always be the _last_ to be discussed, not the first.
              SNMP is nowhere mentioned in the draft. Sooner or later, you're
