   <abstract>
   <t>
   The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to achieve
   properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At the same
   time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and justify the
   extra effort of going wireless. This document presents some of these
   use-cases.

<section title="Introduction">

    <t>
      The main purpose of this document is to details the requirements
      of the operations, administration and maintenance (OAM) features
      recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastrutue
      on top of a collection of wireless networks. In particular,
      we expect to provide packet loss evaluation, self-testing and
      automated adaptation to enable trade-offs between resilience
      and energy consumption.
   </t>

   <t>
      In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition
      specified in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      We expect to implement an OAM framework in PAW networks to maintain a real-time
      view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
      Agreements (delay, reliability) assigned to each data flow.
