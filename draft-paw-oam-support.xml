   <t>
   The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to achieve
   properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At the same
   time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and justify the
   extra effort of going wireless. This document presents some of these
   use-cases.

<section title="Introduction">

    <t>
      The main purpose of this document is to details the requirements
      of the operations, administration and maintenance (OAM) features
      recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastrutue
      on top of a collection of wireless networks. In particular,
      we expect to provide packet loss evaluation, self-testing and
      automated adaptation to enable trade-offs between resilience
      and energy consumption.
   </t>

   <t>
       This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for
       using OAM in wireless networks to provide availability and predictability.
       </t>
    
   <t>
      In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition
      specified in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      We expect to implement an OAM framework in RAW networks to maintain a real-time
      view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
      Agreements (delay, reliability) assigned to each data flow.
   </t>
 
 
   <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
         <list style="symbols">
            <t>
               OAM entity: a data flow to be controled;
            </t>
            
            <t>
               OAM end-devices: the source or destination of a data flow;

         <t>
            defect: a temporary change in the network characteristics (e.g.
            link quality degradation because of temporary external interference,
            a mobile obstacle)
         </t>
         
         <t>
            fault: a definite change which may affect the network performance, e.g.
            a node runs out of energy,

<section title="OAM to provision appropriately the resources">
   <t>
      RAW networks expect to make the communications predictable on top of a
      wireless network infrastructure. Most critical applications will define
      a Service Level Agreeemnt to respect for the data flows it generates.
      Thus, the wireless networks have to be dimensionned to respect these SLAs.
      </t>
   
   <t>
      To respect strict guarantees, RAW relies on a PCE which has to schedule
      the transmissions in the different wireless networks. Thus, resources
      have to be provisionned to handle any defect. OAM represents the core of
      the overprovisonning process, and maintains the network operational by
      updating the schedule dynmically.
      </t>
   
   <t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple path have to be provisionned
      so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever the conditions.
      OAM is in charge of controling the recplication/ process
      </t>
   
   
   <t>
      To be energy-efficient, reserving some dedicated out-of-band resources
      for OAM seems ireealistic, and only in-band solutions are considered here.
      </t>

   </section>
<section title="Administration">
   
   <t>
      To take proper decisions, the network has to expose a collection of metrics
      
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>
            Packet losses: the time-window average and maximum values of the
            number of packet losses has to be measured. Many critical applications
            stop to work if a few consecutive packets are dropped;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a very common metric
            in wireless to denote the link quality. The radio chipset is in charge
            of translating a received signal strngth into a normalized
            quality indicator;
            </t>
         
         <t>
            Delay: the time elapsed between a packet generation / enqueuing
            and its reception by the destination;
            </t>
         
      </list>
      </t>
   <t>
      These metrics should be collected:
      <list style="symbols">
         <t>
            per virtual circuit to measure the end-to-end performance for a given flow.
            Each of the paths has to be isolated in multipath strategies;
            </t>
         
         <t>per radio channel to measure e.g. the level of external interfence,
            and to be able to apply counter-measures (e.g. blacklisting)
            </t>
         
         <t>
            per device to detect misbehaving node, when it relays the packets of
            several flows.
            </t>
         </list>
   </t>
      
   
   
   <section title="Energy efficiency requirements">
      <t>
         RAW targets also low-power wireless networks, where energy represents a key
         constraint. Thus, we have to cake care of the energy and bandwidth consumption.
         The following techniques aim to reduce the cost of such maintenance:
         <list>
            <t>
               piggybacking: some control information has inserted in the data packets
               if they don't fragment the packet (i.e. the MTU is not exceeded). Information
               Elements represent a standardized way to handle such information;
               </t>
            
            <t>
               flags/fields: we have to set-up flags in the packets to monitor to be able
               to monitor them accurately. A sequence number field may help to detect packet
               losses. Similarly, path inference tools such as <xref target="ipath"/> insert
               additionnal information in the headers to identify the path followed by a
               packet a posteriori.
               </t>
            </list>
