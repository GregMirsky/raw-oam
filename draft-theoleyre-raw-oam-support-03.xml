<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
        Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) is an effort that extends DetNet
        to approach end-to-end deterministic performances over a network that
        includes scheduled wireless segments.
        In wired networks, many approaches try to enable Quality of Service (QoS) by
        implementing traffic differentiation so that routers handle differently each type of packets.
        However, this differentiated treatment was expensive for most applications.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref target="RFC8655"/> has proposed to provide a bounded end-to-end latency
        on top of the network infrastructure, comprising both Layer 2 bridged and Layer 3 routed segments.
        Their work encompasses the data plane, OAM, time synchronization, management, control, and security aspects.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        However, wireless networks create specific challenges.
        First of all, radio bandwdidth is significantly lower than for wired networks.
        In these conditions, the volume of signaling messages has to be very limited.
        Even worse, wireless links are lossy: a layer 2 transmission may or may not be 
        decoded correctly by the receiver, depending on a large set of parameters.
        Thus, providing high reliability through wireless segments only is particularly challenging.
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Wired networks rely on the concept of <spanx style="emph">links</spanx>. All the devices attached
        to a link receive any transmission. The concept of link in wireless networks is much more weird.
        A receiver may or may not receive a transmission, depending on a colliding transmission, the
        quality of the radio channel, and external interference.
        Besides, a wireless transmissions is broadcast by nature: any <spanx style="emph">neighboring</spanx>
        device may be able to decode it. We will detail what are the implications on the OAM features.
        
    </t>
    
    <t>
        Last but not least, radio links present very unstable characteristics.
        If the wireless networks use an unlicensed band, packet losses are not anymore temporally
        and spatially independent.
        Typically, links may exhibit a very bursty characteristic, where several 
        consecutive packets may be dropped.
        Thus, providing availability and reliability on top of the wireless infrastructure 
        requires specific layer 3 mechanisms to counteract these bursty losses. 
    </t>
	   
    <t>
        Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools are of primary importance
        for IP networks <xref target="RFC7276"/>.
        It defines a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance measurement.
    </t>
       
    <t>
        The main purpose of this document is to detail the specific requirements of the OAM
        features recommended to construct a predictable communication infrastructure
        on top of a collection of wireless segments.
      	This document describes the benefits, problems, and trade-offs for using OAM in 
    	wireless networks to provide availability and predictability.
	</t>
    
   <t>
      	In this document, the term OAM will be used according to its definition specified 
      	in <xref target="RFC6291"/>.
      	We expect to implement an OAM framework in RAW networks to maintain a real-time 
      	view of the network infrastructure, and its ability to respect the Service Level
          Objectives (SLO), such as delay and reliability, assigned to each data flow.

<!-- INTEREST OF OAM          -->
<section title="Role of OAM in RAW">
	<t>
      RAW networks expect to make the communications reliable and predictable on top of a
      wireless network infrastructure. 
      Most critical applications will define an SLO to be required for the data flows it
      generates.
      RAW considers network plane protocol elements such as OAM to improve the RAW operation 
      at the service and the forwarding sub-layers.
	</t>


	<t>
      To respect strict guarantees, RAW relies on an orchestrator able to monitor and
      maintain the network. Typically, a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller is in charge of scheduling the transmissions
      in the deployed network, based on the radio link characteristics, SLO of the flows, the
      number of packets to forward.
      Thus, resources have to be provisioned a priori to handle any defect. 
      OAM represents the core of the over provisioning process, and maintains the network 
      operational by updating the schedule dynamically.
	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
Strictly speaking, PREOF also includes an order preservation. Do you see it as the required element in RAW?
-->

	<t>
      Fault-tolerance also assumes that multiple paths have to be provisioned
      so that an end-to-end circuit keeps on existing whatever the conditions.
      The replication/elimination processes (PREOF) on a node is typically controlled by the
      central controller/orchestrator.
      OAM is in charge of controlling that PREOF is working properly on a node and within the domain.
	</t>

<!-- TODO-Greg-
I think that out-of-band OAM is useful in case of passive OAM that collects counters, statistics from the nodes, e.g., SNMP or Netconf/Restconf using YANG-based data models. Such methods may be used as systems have control and management channels already.
-->
	<t>
      To be energy-efficient, reserving some dedicated out-of-band resources
      for OAM seems idealistic, and only in-band solutions are considered here.
	</t>


	<t>
       RAW supports both proactive and on-demand troubleshooting.
	</t>
    
    <t>
        We will detail now the specific characteristics of RAW.

    	OAM features will enable RAW with robust operation both for forwarding and routing 
    	purposes.
	</t>
    
    <!-- TODO-Greg-
    We can clarify that this is a method of passive OAM (according to RFC 7799 classification of OAM performance measurement methods).
    -->

    <section title="Information Collection">
           <t>
               Several solutions (e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), YANG-based data models) are already in charge of collecting the statistics.
               That way, we can encapsulate these statistics in specific monitoring packets, to send them to the controller.
               </t>
           </section>

    
    
    <section title="Continuity Check">
		<t>
			We need to verify that two endpoints are connected.
            In other words, there exists "one" way to deliver the packets between
            two endpoints A and B. The solution may not here defer from those of detnet.
 		</t>
        
        </section>

        
        <section title="Connectivity Verification">

		<t>
            Additionally, to the Continuity Check, we have to verify the connectivity.
            This verification considers additional constraints, i.e., the absence of
            misconnection.
        </t>
        <t>
            In particular, the resources have to be reserved by a given flow, and no
             packets from other flows steal the corresponding resources. Similarly, the
             destination does not receive packets from different flows through its interface.
        </t>
        
        <!-- TODO-Fabrice
        To focus on wireless aspects, i.e., what is different from detnet.
        -->
        <t>
            Because of the broadcast nature of radio transmissions, several receivers may be
            active at the same time, to enable anycast layer-2 forwarding. Thus, the connectivity
            verification must test any combination.
            We also consider priority based mechanisms for anycast fowarding, i.e., all the receivers
            haven't the same probability to forward a packet.
            To verify a delay SLO for a given flow, we must also consider all the possible combinations,
            leading to a probability distribution function for end-to-end transmissions.
            If this verification is implemented
            naively, the number of combinations to test may be exponential, and thus, too costly
            for wireless networks with a low bandwidth.
        </t>
     
    
        <t>
			It is worth noting that the control and data packets may not follow the same
            path, and the connectivity verification has to be conducted in-band without
            impacting the data traffic.
            <!-- TODO-Greg-
            It is critical for both CC, CV and, in general, active OAM methods. I think it can be listed in the Requirements for OAM in RAW section.
            -->
            Test packets must share the fate with the monitored data traffic without introducing congestion in normal network conditions.
		</t>


	</section>
        
        
   
    <section title="Route Tracing">
		<t>
       		ICMP tools are very common tools for diagnostic.
       		<!-- GP: we may check with Pascal, if he agrees, we may introduce the concepts of Bitmap-->
       		They help to identify a subset of the list of routers in the route.
       		To be predictable, resources are reserved per flow in RAW.
       		Thus, we need to define route tracing tools able to track the route for a 
       		specific flow.
		</t>


		<t>
            Wireless networks are meshed by nature: we have many redundant radio links.
            These meshed networks are both an asset and a drawback: while several paths exist
            between two endpoints, we should choose the most efficient one(s), concerning
            specifically the reliability, and the delay.
           </t>
        
        <t>
            Thus, multipath routing can be considered to make the network fault-tolerant.
            Even better, we can exploit the broadcast nature of wireless networks to exploit
            meshed multipath routing: we may have multiple Maintenance Intermediate Endpoints for each
            hop in the path.
            In that way, each Maintenance Intermediate Endpoint has several possible next hops
            in the forwarding plane.
			Thus, all the possible paths between two maintenance endpoints should be 
			retrieved.
        </t>
    </section>

   
	<section title="Fault Verification/detection">
		<t>
      		RAW expects to operate fault-tolerant networks. 
      		Thus, we need mechanisms able to detect faults, before they impact the network 
      		performance.
		</t>


		<t>
     		The network has to detect when a fault occurred, i.e., the network has deviated
             from its expected behavior.
     		While the network must report an alarm, the cause may not be identified 
     		precisely. 
     		For instance, the end-to-end reliability has decreased significantly, or a 
     		buffer overflow occurs.

    	<t>
        	The network has isolated and identified the cause of the fault.

         Since wireless networks are known to be lossy, RAW has to implement strategies to improve reliability on top of unreliable links.
         Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) has typically to enable retransmissions
         based on the end-to-end reliability and latency requirements.
      </t>
      
      <t>
         To make correct decisions, the controller needs to know the distribution
         of packet losses for each flow, and each hop of the paths.
         In other words, the average end-to-end statistics are not enough.
         They must allow the controller to predict the worst-case.

   <section title="Energy efficiency constraint">
      <t>
         RAW targets also low-power wireless networks, where energy represents a key
         constraint.
         Thus, we have to take care of power and bandwidth consumption.
         The following techniques aim to reduce the cost of such maintenance:
         <list>
            <t>
               piggybacking: some control information are inserted in the data packets
               if they do not fragment the packet (i.e., the MTU is not exceeded).
               Information Elements represent a standardized way to handle such information;
               </t>
            
            <t>
               flags/fields: we have to set-up flags in the packets to monitor to be able
               to monitor the forwarding process accurately.
               A sequence number field may help to detect packet losses.
               Similarly, path inference tools such as <xref target="ipath"/> insert
               additional information in the headers to identify the path followed by a
               packet a posteriori.

   <section title="Maintenance">
      <t>
         RAW needs to implement a self-healing and self-optimization approach.
         The network must continuously retrieve the state of the network,
         to judge about the relevance of a reconfiguration, quantifying:
         <list>
            <t> the cost of the sub-optimality: resources may not be used
               optimally (e.g., a better path exists);
            </t>
            <t>
               the reconfiguration cost: the controller needs to trigger some
               reconfigurations.
               For this transient period, resources may be twice reserved, and control packets have to be transmitted.
            </t>
         </list>
         Thus, reconfiguration may only be triggered if the gain is significant.
         </t>

      <section title="Multipath Routing">
           <t>
               To be fault-tolerant, several paths can be reserved between two maintenance
               endpoints. 
               They must be node-disjoint so that a path can be available at any time.
               </t>
           
           </section>
           
      <section title="Replication / Elimination">
          <t>
              When multiple paths are reserved between two maintenance endpoints,
              they may decide to replicate the packets to introduce redundancy, and
              thus to alleviate transmission errors and collisions. 
              For instance, in <xref target="fig_replication"/>, the source node S is 
              transmitting the packet to both parents, nodes A and B.              
              Each maintenance endpoint will decide to trigger the replication/elimination
              process when a set of metrics passes through a threshold value.

      <section title="Resource Reservation">
          <t>
            Because the QoS criteria associated with a path may degrade, the network has
            to provision additional resources along the path. We need to provide
            mechanisms to patch a schedule (changing the channel offset, allocating more
            timeslots, changing the path, etc.).
            </t>
          
        </section>
      
      <section title="Soft transition after reconfiguration">
          <t>
              Since RAW expects to support real-time flows, we have to support soft-reconfiguration,
              where the novel resources are reserved before the ancient ones are released.
              Some mechanisms have to be proposed so that packets are forwarded through the
              novel track only when the resources are ready to be used, while maintaining
              the global state consistent (no packet reordering, duplication, etc.)

           3 principles for high reliability:
           <list style="symbols">
           
               <t>

               <t> reliable crossover: This is not treated explicitly but is tacit within 5.2. Internet
               Protocol executes the principle. The problem with this draft is it
               advocates adding state into the routing fabric without seeming to
               realize that that tends to defeat the reliable crossover principle. 5.3
               resource reservation clearly does this. Therefore, I recommend that the
               reliable crossover principle get explicit treatment at this stage so
               the tradeoffs can be properly weighed.
                 (We've gone through resource reservation protocols before - remember
               RSVP? - and they've not been very successful).

                   
                   </t>
           <t>detection of faults as they occur: 3.3 and 3.4 treat this, but, IMHO, the organization should again be
           cleaned up.  Back in the days when Simple Network Management Protocol
           was being worked up, a common acronym was FCAPS for [Fault Configuraion
           Accounting Performance Security]. Sounds to me like a pattern that this
           discussion could be mapped onto.
              In this case we have performance management solutions commingled
           with fault management ones. My experience is that QoS issues should
           always be the _last_ to be discussed, not the first.
              SNMP is nowhere mentioned in the draft. Sooner or later, you're
           going to need gets, sets and traps.  Is now the right time?
